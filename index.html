    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Greenplate app serves as a way to allow the user to effectively manage their meals while meeting their calorie goals. The app is beneficial for those wanting to adopt a healthier lifestyle and develop a sustainable diet with ingredients and recipes that are readily available to the user. The app simplifies the organizational process involving various recipes, allowing the user to focus on making food that meets their caloric goals and their grocery shopping. The app promotes sustainable food management by assisting the user in purchasing ingredients based on their caloric goals and desired meals. This mitigates food wastage while promoting a healthier lifestyle.</p>

    <h2 id="design-and-architecture">Design and Architecture</h2>
    <p>Our app follows the MVVM architecture which stands for Model View ViewModel architecture. This architecture is used for full-stack applications that have a UI component and a backend logic component and helps with separating the two parts. This model is popular on many full stack applications especially mobile applications like Android Studio, which is what we used for our framework. The model represents the backend logic of the code, the view represents the frontend UI elements, and the ViewModel is the middle-man that connects both parts to create an effective app. One example when a button is clicked, the ViewModel will gather that data on the view and translate the backend logic of the button function to the data model.</p>
    <p><strong>The following here is our Design Class Diagram:</strong></p>

    <p>1. (SD) Log Meal Main success scenario: A registered app user logs in with their account into GreenPlate and enters the meal with the calculated calories they want to track on the Input Meal screen. The system takes the meal, its expected calorie count, and the date it was logged and stores it in the userâ€™s account for the user to track and updates the daily calorie intake by the calorie count of the meal logged.</p>
    <p>Alternate scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If an app user leaves either the email or password blank, the system will prompt them with a message indicating that one or more fields were empty.</li>
        <li>If an app user does not log in with the valid account information, the Firebase authentication system will prompt them with a message stating authentication failure.</li>
        <li>If the meal calorie is not a valid number, the system will prompt the user to input a valid, nonnegative calorie count.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GRASP: Ingredients Class</h3>
    <p>Ingredients class is a clear example of the information expert. All the attributes relating to a particular ingredient such as its name, quantity, caloriesperServing and expiration date are set in this class. These attributes can also be retrieved using the getter methods also defined in the class.</p>

    <p>Through this project, our group was able to practice design patterns through the Android App project. Here were some of the contributions of our members:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dahyun & Aishani: A lot of UI troubleshooting, insert specific items here</li>
        <li>Anuj & Vansh: Splash screens, diagramming, website content</li>
        <li>Saketh: Nontechnical tasks, Website infrastructure, git troubleshooting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encountered several problems throughout this project. Here are some specific instances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrating our ShoppingList Backend with our UI</li>
        <li>Following MVVM design architecture during Sprint 1</li>
        <li>Coordinating different requirements that are dependent on each other</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But by overcoming these challenges, we have learned how to more effectively communicate and plan sprints together as a team.</p>
